🍄 Mushroom Classification

This project aims to classify mushrooms based on their physical characteristics using various machine learning algorithms.

 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains features like odor, gill-size, stalk-shape, spore-print-color, etc., all of which are categorical. The target variable represents mushroom classes (e.g., edible or poisonous).

⚙️ Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest  

 ✅ Workflow

- Data preprocessing (encoding, cleaning)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Confusion matrix and metrics visualization

 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix (visualized using seaborn)

🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate models
